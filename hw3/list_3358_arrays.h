/*  list_3358.h
  CS 3358 Spring 2008
  updated Spring 2009 and Fall 2009
  
  a very simple cursor based List ADT
  
  This implentation will use a simulated doubly-linked list that uses arrays.
  
  The constant EOL will be assinged the value -1 and signifies the end of the list
  and the beginning of the list.
  
  We will not use user-defined templates for this program.
  
    -It is homogenious -- the elements in the collection are all of the same type.
    -It has a finite length (the number of elements).
    -The elements are arranged sequentially:
          o There is a first element and a last element
          o Every element except the last has a unique successor
          o Every element except the first has a unique predecessor
