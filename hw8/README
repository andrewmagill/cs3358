HW Assignment 8

Binary Search Tree and Breadth First Search

The goal of this assignment was to implement a Queue using a circular
array, and to then use that Queue in the implementation of a Breadth
First Search method used in our Binary Search Tree.

    To Build:

    $ make

    To Run:

    $ test_bfs bst_bfs_test_input.txt

The BST was already implemented by Dr. Priebe, we only need to implement
the BFS method.

In order to test this method, I have created a small test program which
reads in a text file of test input.

The test file is composed from commands like insert, delete, etc. along
with test values.

Valid commands:

insert, delete, isempty, isfull, find, inorder

Syntax:

Values are contained within parenthesis, when appropriate:

insert(42)
delete(42)
find(42)
isempty
isfull
isorder

Output is printed to the terminal.

In order to run the program, please provide the name of an input test file
as a parameter to the test program.

To Build:

$ make

To Run:

$ test_bfs bst_bfs_test_input.txt
